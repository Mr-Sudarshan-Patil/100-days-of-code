# 100 Days of Code Challenge - MERN Stack

Hey everyone! Welcome to my 100-day coding journey! I'm diving deep into the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Here's how my journey has been so far:

## Day 1-14: HTML Basics

In the first two weeks, I focused on getting a solid grasp of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the building block of web pages. I learned how to create the structure of a web page using tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

## Day 15-28: CSS Fundamentals

During these two weeks, I delved into CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to make my web pages look stylish and presentable. I explored CSS properties like `color`, `font-size`, and `margin` to enhance the visual appeal of my projects.

## Day 29-42: Bootstrap for Responsive Design

For the next two weeks, I learned Bootstrap, a CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and mobile-first websites. I used Bootstrap's grid system and components to build layouts that look great on all devices.

## Day 43-49: JavaScript Basics

In the following week, I started learning JavaScript, the programming language of the web. I covered the basics like variables, data types, and control flow, which are essential for building interactive web applications.

## Day 50-52: Terminal Mastery

For the next three days, I dedicated time to mastering the command-line interface (CLI) using the Terminal or Command Prompt. I learned how to navigate file systems, execute commands, and manage files efficiently.

## Day 53-55: Git and GitHub Essentials

In the next three days, I focused on version control using Git and collaboration using GitHub. I learned how to initialize repositories, track changes, create branches, and collaborate with others on projects.

## Day 56-57: Introduction to Node.js

Today, I started my journey with Node.js, the server-side JavaScript runtime. I installed Node.js on my local machine and created my first Node.js application. I'm excited to explore how Node.js can power the backend of my MERN stack projects!
